## Celebrating the Wheel of the Year

This page is the index for the webpages I have made to celebrate the wheel of the year.

Living life in the aspect of eternity can't be our whole lives, but a scheduled return to this state of mind is a humbling sacrifice to the depths of being we can never comprehend.
